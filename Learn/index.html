           <h2>Mozilla Developer Network</h2>
           <p>This site will provide loads of documentation of web development. Its goal is to get you “comfortable” with development, though placing an unusual emphasis on why things work. There are activities throughout the documents, particularly in the higher level ones. However, a warning must go out to those who don’t have tons of time, as this certainly requires massive amounts of that. One page takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. It’s also highly recommended you take notes, while reading the documents</p>

             <li>Miniature, optional, exams for every module </li>

           <p>Very quick bites of highly specific information are easily found in the logically laid out library. Think of this more as a Google search for web development concepts, than a guided tutorial. However, the freedom offers great flexibility for developing your own site. Most people will migrate to this one after they’ve got the basic concepts mastered. It’s questionably useful for complete beginners</p>

           <h2>Codecademy</h2>
           <p>It’s quite likely you’ve heard about Codecademy in you past searches, as the majority of people seem to learn web development off here. This one does teach you to code through making you code, which theoretically should simulate a real-life development situation. However, the hand-held guided approach will frustrate many of those who would like to develop with their own style. Such a service will only provide the fundamentals of developing sites</p>

             <li>Notices and points out syntax errors</li>
             <li>Very guided practice</li>
           </ul>

             <li>Poor simulation of real development</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Ends up giving many beginners a false sense of what web development actually consists of, by completely cutting out the creativity in web design</p>

           <h2>Freecodecamp</h2>
           <p>A very similar site to Codecademy. In differences, you’ll find this one has a lot more prominence in how to build the site most efficiently. While this may sound good, beginners usually have the goal of learning not developing, which requires a different mindset. Efficiency is only valued for professionals, who don’t care how it gets done, as long as it gets done. Those who already mastered basic concepts commonly go back to this one, to improve their efficiency</p>

             <li>Hundreds of hours of free content</li>
             <li>See Codecademy (above) for other pros</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Phone screen simulates more likely scenario. It teaches the most efficient way to develop sites</p>

           </ul>
           <p>Being even more restrictive than Codecademy seriously leaves the wrong impression on beginners. It focuses more on building the site than learning to build a site</p>

           <h2>Sololearn</h2>
           <p>With a large community and multiple social media-like concepts, Sololearn keeps you in touch will people in all stages of learning. The actual learning area is very self motivated, hence the name Sololearn. It provides an uncontested mobile experience, which is great for those on the go. Even the method of splitting content feels like it was made for people who only have 20 minutes a day, for quick learning sessions. Highly recommended on public transit</p>
