          <p class="title slc-red">Getting Github</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">Before you even start writing your code, it’s highly recommended to connect your project to a Github repository. It’s free and allows for a cloud backup. You’ll also be able to go back to an older revision of your code, which is really helpful if you messed up and saved. In addition to all that, you can choose to create an organization, which will let others modify your repository. Don’t worry though, someone random off the internet needs your permission, before they can edit the master branch</p>

          <p class="title slc-red">Code editor</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">You’ll start any web development project within your editor. Microsoft Visual Studio is quite popular, though we here at Acumen use Atom. All editors have the same fundamental functionality, they allow writing programs, so it really doesn’t matter which one you choose. We’d highly recommend getting some plugins, for whatever language you’re working with, as they can seriously speed up the process</p>

          <p class="title slc-red">Final revision</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">After writing your code, commit your changes to the repository master branch. Now, you should probably have a friend or colleague look over your site, for some final touches</p>

          <p class="title slc-red">Connect to Netlify</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">With the code sleek and clean, it’s time to hook the repository up to Netlify. This free service will generate a free DNS, allow for free HTTPS, and really fast performance times. Follow the instructions and make certain to link with Github. This will just save a lot of time later on, as this way Netlify setup only has to be done once</p>

          <p class="title slc-red">Custom domain</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">Now most people don’t want http://quirky-raman-8c1296.netlify.com/, or something along those lines, as their domain. Admittedly Netlify doesn’t generate easy to remember domains, so you’ll have to buy your own. Godaddy is the registrar we used, which got us acumensyndicate.ca for C$1.04 in 2018. It’s best to look around for whichever is going to get you the cheapest price, though be warned that some suffixes cost significantly more than others</p>

          <p class="title slc-red">Free custom domain</p>
          <p class="written slc-red">Being the only step in our whole guide that requires money, we’ve found a free alternative registrar! Freenom is a DNS resolver who also happens to be a registry. They’ve got 5 suffixes that are free! These are: .tk .ml .ga .cf .gq. You can only use this domain for 1 year, though we’d recommend just switching to another one next year. If you happen to really like the domain, you can buy it afterwards</p>
