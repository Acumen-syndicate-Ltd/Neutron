By reversing the colour placment, within the selector, we integrated simplicity into seeing what words are selected. This is done all while keeping to the same theme and simplicity. A footer was added to the bottom of the page. A code button has been integrated into the header. Smooth access to the site's opensource code is a necessity to site developers. Viewers may now access critical information, which was hidden before, with a simple scroll and click. Titles have dramatically improved.

The Acumen syndicate .Ltd logo has been placed as the site icon. “Acumen syndicate .Ltd” title was given a 3d effect, using a hefty layer of stacked shadows. Site performance slowed down marginally from this. All the fonts on the site were changed to the web safe sans-serif. A dual colour contrast, between #ffffff and #9c2020, was set as the site theme. This is also the first version of the site that was publically available, as connection to the acumensyndicate.ca DNS only happened at this stage</span>
